# Image Translator GUI
 GUI for the Open-Source Manga Image Translator

# Images? Translation?
Open up the world wide web! This program lets you select or drag and drop files from your computer/browser, and translates all the text in the image to a target language. This project completes the open source image translator program. The image translator GUI is a user friendly application where you can scroll through all the images youve translated, drag and drop, and use widgets like switches/buttons instead of reading through documentation and using the command line argument parser.
